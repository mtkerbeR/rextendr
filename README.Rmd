## Installation

To install the package, run:
```r
remotes::install_github("extendr/rextendr")
```

Note that this will install the package but does not guarantee that the package can do anything useful. You will also need to set up a working Rust toolchain. See the [installation instructions for libR-sys](https://github.com/extendr/libR-sys) for help. If you can successfully build libR-sys you're good.

## Usage

Basic use example:

```{r}
library(rextendr)

# create a Rust function
rust_function("fn add(a:f64, b:f64) -> f64 { a + b }")

# call it from R
add(2.5, 4.7)
```

The package also enables a new chunk type for knitr, `extendr`, which compiles and evaluates Rust code. For example, a code chunk such as this one:
````markdown
`r ''````{extendr}
rprintln!("Hello from Rust!");

let x = 5;
let y = 7;
let z = x*y;

z
```
````
would create the following output in the knitted document:
```{extendr}
rprintln!("Hello from Rust!");

let x = 5;
let y = 7;
let z = x*y;

z
```
